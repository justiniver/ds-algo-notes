# Segmented Least Squares

![Segmented Least Squares Basics](/Users/justiniverson/Desktop/codingstuff/CS3000/ds-algo-notes/resources/sls.png)

- The idea is that using a least squares solution over the entire dataset would not be a good fit
- How can we partition the graph/data so that we can minimize 'cost' (i.e., smallest number of segments that represents 
the data well)

### Using the Dynamic Programming approach
- Identify the subproblems
- Identify the base case
